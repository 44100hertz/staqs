* SECTION 0 - Introduction
** The STRPG Guidebook
If you haven't read the rulebook, go do that and come back. The
guidebook is here to add a "why" to the rulebook, and to give
suggestions on DM'ing and playing STRPG.
** Why seperate the books?
You have to follow the rules. You don't have to follow the
guide. That's all there is to it.
* SECTION 1 - Using the rulebook
** Rules are Rules!
Not following the rules makes STRPG worse for everyone.
